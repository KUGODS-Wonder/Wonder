* Users can find these stickers at the end of their walk.
* When they take their phone cameras upon the sticker, our AI model recognizes it and uploads it on our app.  
* By using mobilnet_v2 model from tensorflow hub it is light, and can solve privacy issues of QR code.
* Since the sticker they find is directly uploaded online, users can find fun accomplishing every walk.
